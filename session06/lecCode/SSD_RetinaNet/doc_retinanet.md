I'll transform your RetinaNet implementation into a comprehensive, pedagogical version matching the style of your YOLO demo and the enhanced SSD version!Perfect! I've transformed your RetinaNet implementation into a comprehensive, pedagogical version that matches the style of your YOLO demo and the enhanced SSD!

## Key Enhancements:

### 📚 **Educational Structure**

- **Clear documentation**: Detailed docstrings explaining concepts
- **Visual separators**: Easy-to-navigate sections
- **Comparative notes**: Highlights differences from SSD
- **Theory explanations**: Focal loss formula and intuition

### 🎯 **RetinaNet-Specific Features**

1. **Feature Pyramid Network (FPN)**:
   - Top-down pathway with lateral connections
   - Multi-scale feature fusion
   - Comments explaining the architecture

2. **Focal Loss**:
   - Complete implementation with formula in docstring
   - Explanation of why it addresses class imbalance
   - Alpha and gamma parameters clearly shown

3. **Deeper Subnets**:
   - 4-layer classification subnet
   - 4-layer regression subnet
   - Shared across pyramid levels

### 📊 **Visualizations & Outputs**

1. **Training Progress**:
   - Epoch-by-epoch metrics
   - Separate tracking of focal loss and localization loss
2. **Training Curves** (`retinanet_training_curves.png`):
   - Total loss evolution
   - Component losses (Focal vs Smooth L1)

3. **Predictions** (`retinanet_predictions.png`):
   - 4 sample visualizations
   - GT boxes (dashed) vs predictions (solid)
   - Confidence scores displayed

### 🎓 **Educational Summary**

The script ends with a comprehensive summary that:

- Lists all demonstrated concepts
- Compares to SSD to highlight unique features
- Explains the key innovation (Focal Loss)

### 🔑 **Key Differences Highlighted**

- **Focal Loss** vs Hard Negative Mining
- **Sigmoid** (no background) vs Softmax (with background)
- **Deeper heads** (4 layers) vs shallow (1 layer)
- **FPN** for better multi-scale fusion

Now you have three complete, pedagogical implementations (YOLO, SSD, RetinaNet) that your students can compare side-by-side to understand the evolution and differences in object detection architectures! Each follows the same structure and visualization style for easy learning.
