## 🎓 Complete Course Progression

Your students now have a **perfect learning path**:

```
1. FPN (Feature Pyramid Networks)
   → Multi-scale feature extraction

2. YOLO (You Only Look Once)
   → Grid-based, anchor boxes, one-stage

3. FCOS (Fully Convolutional One-Stage)
   → Anchor-free, per-pixel, FPN integration

4. DETR (Detection Transformer)
   → Transformers, set prediction, no NMS
```

**Learning Journey:**

- **FPN**: Foundation - multi-scale features
- **YOLO**: Traditional one-stage with grids
- **FCOS**: Modern anchor-free with FPN
- **DETR**: Revolutionary transformer-based

## 🚀 How to Use DETR

```bash
# Save as detr_complete.py
pip install torch scipy numpy matplotlib

python detr_complete.py
```
